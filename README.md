This is the Data challenge for me (Pratiwi Kartika) and Tajunissa Akbar from AI/ Machine Learning Bootcamp using Python, conducted by Code to Change.

The Problem to Solve : 
Digital Starling aims to match Entrepreneurs with Freelancers with AI powered platform. 
Therefore we had to build an AI model that can take factors like skillset, expertise level and rates into consideration and build an accurate tool that met the aforementioned need.

Solution :
1. Used cosine similarity algorithm; 
2. Built a new database; 
3. Added an algorithm that provides cosine similarity with matching words between input and database resulting in increase in the similarity index; 
4. Added extra features like level of expertise and hourly rate to UI; 
5. Automated scripts
