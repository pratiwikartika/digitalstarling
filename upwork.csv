I am a full-time freelancer with over five and a half years of experience. While I initially started off as a social media manager and content writer, I shifted my focus entirely to the cyber security industry in 2017. 

Having a techno-legal academic background, I specialize in regulatory compliance, privacy, and data protection laws. In the last three years, I have worked on regulations and standards such as ISO 27001:2013, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, Cyber Essentials, Privacy Shield, the Information Technology Act, 2000, etc. 

In February 2019, I passed the required assessment for Information Security Management System (ISMS) Lead Auditor Course (ISO 27001:2013). More information about my academic background, qualifications, and relevant work experience is available in my Upwork profile.

Previously, I have been invited to multiple national-level discussions on the proposed draft of the Indian Personal Data Protection Bill. As a pro bono initiate, I, along with The Cyber Blog India team, have assisted more than 8200 cyber crime victims in the last five years along with delivering 275+ workshops and investigation training sessions.


If you are an individual or an organization looking to improvise your cyber security policies and procedures or comply with a regulatory standard, feel free to get in touch with me and we can easily work out the specifics.
